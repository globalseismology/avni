AVNI is a software ecosystem for analyzing and interpreting planetary models and data sets that were initially
designed or the three-dimensional reference Earth model project |REM3D|.
The codes are primary written in Python with interfaces to legacy routines in C and Fortran.
Some installation files as well as applets and API access require registration on the |register| link.

* Open-source Python package with APIs to handle intensive queries |GNU GPL|
* Introduce HDF5 storage formats for planetary models and processed seismic data
* Interactive web-based visualization tools for data and model exploration
* Formulate and benchmark solvers for rapid data validation of models
